# The Importance of Software Architecture

## Overview:

- Architecture is an abstraction of a system
    * Everything is built on layers
    * Define the properties of components -> makes assumptions
    * Well formed assumptions can save you a lot of hassle down the road of building an app

- Why is Software Architecture important?
    * Because it represents the **earliest design decisions**
        * These decisions are usually the hardest ones to change
        * They are the most critical to get right
    * A good architecture is the key to maintainable and reusable code

- What are Functional Requirements?
    * Functional Requirements define:
        * What the system must do
        * How will the different components will interact between one another (relationship)
        * What does "functioning properly" means to me in the context of the app I'm planning to build

- Important quality attributes:
    * Modifiability
    * Interoperability
    * Availability
    * Security
    * Predictability
    * Portability

- **Interoperability**: Interoperability is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or products without special effort on the part of the customer.

- Common mistakes and pitfalls:
    * Lack of adequate architectural knowledge/experience
    * Insufficient time spent on architectural design and analysis
    * Failure to identify the quality drivers and design for them
    * Failure to properly document and communicate the architecture
    * Failure to understand that standards are not a replacement for software architecture
    * Failure to make sure that the architecture directs the implementation
    * Failure to evolve your architecture and properly document your progress/changes as you go
